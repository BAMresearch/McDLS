Welcome to McSAS: a tool for analysis of SAS patterns. This tool can extract form-free size distributions from small-angle scattering data using the Monte-Carlo method described in:

Brian R. Pauw, Jan Skov Pedersen, Samuel Tardif, Masaki Takata, and Bo B. Iversen. *“Improvements and Considerations for Size Distribution Retrieval from Small-angle Scattering Data by Monte Carlo Methods.”* Journal of Applied Crystallography 46, no. 2 (February 14, 2013    ). [doi:10.1107/S0021889813001295](http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0021889813001295).

The GUI and latest improvements are described in:
Ingo Breßler, Brian R. Pauw, Andreas Thünemann, *"McSAS: A package for extracting quantitative form-free distributions"*. Submitted to J. Appl. Cryst., manuscript available on arXiv:1412.1900(http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1900).

The package is currently in beta state, of which a Windows binary is available in the downloads section. The current beta branch is the "restructuring"-branch, which should run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. A quick start guide and example data is included in the "doc"-directory that comes with the distribution. 

Several form factors have been included in the package, including:
 - Spheres
 - Cylinders (spherically isotropic)
 - Ellipsoids (spherically isotropic)
 - Core-shell spheres and ellipsoids
 - Gaussian chain
 - Kholodenko worm
 - Densely packed spheres (LMA-PY structure factor).
